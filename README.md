## ❓ Introduction

I’m a Full-Stack Developer and Computer Science student with a strong foundation in scalable systems, performance optimization, and user-focused design.

My journey began in game development, where I built custom multiplayer frameworks and gameplay systems for **Grand Theft Auto V (FiveM)**. Through projects like the Mercy Framework,
I gained hands-on experience with **Lua, TypeScript, Node.js, Svelte, HTML, CSS**, and databases such as **MySQL** and **MongoDB**.

That experience taught me how to:
- Design scalable architectures
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Optimize performance-critical systems
- Collaborate effectively within development teams

Today, my focus is on modern web and software development — building efficient, reliable applications that balance technical performance with great user experience.

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Computer Science at Karel De Grote University, where I continue expanding my expertise in backend systems and frontend architecture.

Driven by curiosity and a passion for problem-solving, I’m always exploring new technologies and building impactful digital solutions.
